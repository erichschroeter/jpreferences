# JPreferences

Java library providing classes for working with Java preferences.

## Description

The JPreferences project is a Java framework using Swing that manages
preferences for an application. The framework is based off of the
[JFace Preferences][0] package architecture.

This project was started because I could not find an equivalent to the
JFace Preferences package that uses Swing. I had written an application
based on Swing and did not want the [SWT][1] dependency.
