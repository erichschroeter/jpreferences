# JPreferences

Contributors: Erich Schroeter

Java framework for managing preferences for your application.

## Description

The JPreferences project is a Java framework using Swing that manages
preferences for an application. The framework is heavily based off of the
[JFace Preferences][JFacePreferences] package architecture.

This project was started because I could not find an equivalent of the
JFace Preferences package that uses Swing. I had written an application
that used Swing and since JFace uses [SWT][SWT_Homepage] I couldn't use
the library.
